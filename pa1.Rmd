This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
activity <-read.csv("./RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity.csv")

```

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```{r, echo=FALSE}
dailysteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity, sum)
hist(dailysteps$steps)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
